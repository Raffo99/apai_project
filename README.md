# APAI Project
This project aimed at implementing and testing two parallel sorting algorithms, radix and bitonic, in CUDA C. 

The primary goal of the project was to leverage the power of GPU parallelism to speed up the sorting process and compare the performance of the two algorithms.

I measured the performance of the algorithms under different conditions, including different input sizes and different numbers of threads, and compared the results to determine which algorithm was faster or more efficient.
